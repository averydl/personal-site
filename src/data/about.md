# Intro

I am a Software Engineer located in the greater Seattle area. I believe software engineering is the most multi-disciplinary field in existence, because there are problems in every domain. It took me about two years of work as a Civil Engineer before I came to this conclusion, but I am thrilled to have made the switch to Software Engineering, and I am excited to see where my new career leads.

# Current Employment

I currently work as a Software Engineer at Visa on the Open VisaNet team, which is working to re-build the existing [VisaNet](https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/visanet.html) using modern open-source technologies. I re-joined Visa in October, 2020 after successfully completing an internship there the previous summer. The primary language I use at work is Go, but I have significant experience with both Java and Python.

# Prior Employment

While I am fairly new to the field, I was diligent about pursuing meaningful work while completing my studies at Bellevue College. I completed a Software Engineering internship at NBCUniversal on the NBC News Digital team from January, 2020 to May, 2020, at the conclusion of which I transitioned into a full-time contract role. I continued working as a Data Engineer contractor until October, 2020, when I switched to my current position at Visa.

My position at NBC focused on creating resilient data pipelines via AWS to ingest and store big data from multiple sources. Data ingestion pipelines were developed using software including Spark, Airflow, and Kafka. I also worked on an internal serverless application used by over 100 NBCU employees. Its primary purpose was to provide real-time alerts whenever NBC News, or certain competing news organizations, published new content. It also provided users with a way to generate audience segments using ingested data, as a means to send targeted push notifications to > 1M mobile app users.

# Education

I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from [Bellevue College](https://bellevuecollege.edu), where I studied from September, 2018 to June, 2020. I also have degrees in Civil Engineering, Chemistry, and Biochemistry from the [University of Washington](https://washington.edu). While my degrees from UW serve primarily as wall decorations, I still love reading about developments in Chemistry and Civil Engineering technology, and I believe this unusual background gives me a unique perspective when it comes to solving problems.

# Personal Life

- I started running in junior high, and completed my first marathon at age 15. While my marathon-running days are behind me, I still run almost every day.
- Prior to COVID-19, I was getting involved with recreational boxing, and I am excited to return as soon as I certain
- Traveling is one of my favorite things to do; before starting my coursework in Computer Science, I took a two-week trip to Mexico City. I am working on learning Spanish, and I hope to find the time to visit Mexico again soon to continue my progress
- Caffeinating myself properly is a lifelong pursuit. Historically, I have used drip coffee makers, french press, and pour-overs to accomplish this. More recently, I purchased a new espresso machine to do the job and so far it has been my favorite.
