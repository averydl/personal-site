# Intro

I am a Software Engineer located in the greater Seattle area. I believe software engineering is the most multi-disciplinary field in existence, as it can be used to solve problems in any domain. It took me about two years of employment as a Civil Engineer before I came to this conclusion, but after a lot of hard work and a second pass at higher eduction, I was able to make the switch to a full-time career in Software Engineering. I am thrilled to be working in such an exciting field, and I can't wait to see where this new career leads me.

# Current Employment

I currently work as a Software Engineer at Visa on the Open VisaNet team, which is working to re-build the existing [VisaNet](https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/visanet.html) using modern open-source technologies. I re-joined Visa in October, 2020 after successfully completing an internship there the previous summer. The primary language I use at work is Go, but I have significant experience with both Java and Python.

# Prior Employment

While I am fairly new to the field, I was diligent about pursuing meaningful work while completing my studies at Bellevue College. I completed a Software Engineering internship at NBCUniversal on the NBC News Digital team from January, 2020 to May, 2020, at the conclusion of which I transitioned into a full-time contract role. I continued working as a Data Engineer contractor until October, 2020, when I switched to my current position at Visa.

My position at NBC focused on creating resilient data pipelines via AWS to ingest and store big data from multiple sources. Data ingestion pipelines were developed using software including Spark, Airflow, and Kafka. I also worked on an internal serverless application used by over 100 NBCU employees. Its primary purpose was to provide real-time alerts whenever NBC News, or certain competing news organizations, published new content. It also provided users with a way to generate audience segments using ingested data, as a means to send targeted push notifications to > 1M mobile app users.

# Education

- I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from [Bellevue College](https://bellevuecollege.edu), where I studied from Sept. 2018 to June 2020.

- I have three degrees in Civil Engineering, Chemistry, and Biochemistry from the [University of Washington](https://washington.edu), where I studied from Sept. 2013 to June 2017.

As is probably clear from my four baccalaureate degrees, I had a hard time finding the right path for myself and deciding on a career. Although I diverged almost entirely from the areas of study I pursued at UW, I am thankful for the time I spent there. Studying a broad range of subjects helped provide me with clarity about my own interests and strengths, which ultimately helped guide me to the field of Software Engineering. And while my degrees from UW serve primarily as wall decorations, I still enjoy reading about new developments in Chemistry and Civil Engineering technology, and I believe my unusual academic background gives me a unique perspective when it comes to solving problems.

# Personal Life

- I started running in junior high, and completed my first marathon at age 15. While my marathon-running days are behind me, I still run almost every day.
- Prior to COVID-19, I was getting involved with recreational boxing, and I am excited to return as soon as things open back up!
- Traveling is one of my favorite things to do. The day after quitting my Civil Engineering job (and before starting my Computer Science curriculum) I took an impromptu trip to Mexico City. I am working on learning Spanish, and I hope to find the time to visit Mexico again soon to continue my progress.
- Caffeinating myself properly is a lifelong pursuit. Historically, I have used drip coffee makers, french press, and pour-overs and to accomplish this. More recently, I purchased a new espresso machine to do the job and so far it has been my favorite.
