# Personal Website

## Overview

This is the source code for my personal website. Check out the final result at [averydl.com](https://averydl.com).

## Deployment

I host this website on AWS, and have automated the deployment with my own [aws-site-deploy](https://github.com/averydl/aws-site-deploy) repo. Feel free to clone or fork that project as well, as it is easily configurable for your own personal domain.

## Acknowledgements

This project was forked and adapted from user mldangelo's [personal-site](https://github.com/mldangelo/personal-site) project.
